# New Fortigate Configuration tool

This is an easy to read / adjust Fortigate configuration script made in Powershell.
<br/>Place the files somewhere on your desktop in a folder (e.g.: \Documents\FGT\ *)
<br/>
<br/>Run .\FGT_Start.ps1 
<br/>
It first checks if Posh-SSH is installed, if not, it will try to install it for you. 
Due too this reason, the first connection takes a little time. <br/>Once it is installed on your pc, the next connection will be fast.  
<br/>
Follow the steps 1-6 for the best experience (it will remember some stuff like wan interface you chose before etc)<br/>
Or pick indiviual options from the menu shown. <br/>
<br/>
It has been tested with Fortigate 5.2.x and 6.0.x, it seems to work on both versions, however use at your own risk 
<br/> Always make a backup just in case.<br/>
